# Leetcode Solutions
solutions for some of the leetcodes I have solved

* Will update with solutions
* No particular language is for all, I usually alternated between python (mainly), java, C#, and some c++
* Will add over period of time for history (As of writing this i have solved 274 problems ranging mainly in easy - medium range)
* NorthSol is my username on Leetcode, if that matters...
* I tend to use a new account around the same name variation though to redo a large amount of problems easily.
