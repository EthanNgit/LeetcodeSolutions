Container With The Most Water
* I Actually really like this problem (its pretty easy for a medium)
* Basically you just need to know some simple math while applying the common two pointer technique
* Since you can only take the lowest peak for the height (remember area for a rectange is A = b * h)
* And you know the base is the distance between the two pointers
* You calculate the area each pointer move and check if its the max height
* Finally check whichever side has the lowest height and move the pointer accordingly
* return the max height
