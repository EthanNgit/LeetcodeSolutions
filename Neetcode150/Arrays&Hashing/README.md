Arrays & Hashing

This is quite possible the most (if not one of the most) integral parts of learning dsa and efficient programming

Learning to articulate arrays can be important if you know you have a very specific sort of data to store together, as most languages arrays are not dynamic, you have to allocate it before.
Given that an array has the space for something inserting an element into an array is always O(1) time as it does not need to do anything special.

Learning the advantages and use cases of a hashmap (dictionary in c# atleast) can be advantageous when you dont exactly know the size of the output. The biggest advantage is the O(1) searching (best case).
Comparing the hashmap to an array, in a hashmap it contains a pointer to the data which allows you to instantly check if it exists, whereas in an array you will have to linearly search (in a non patterned array).

These problems demonstrate a few use cases of arrays and hashmaps.
